### Source: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on individuals, communities, and societies worldwide. The pandemic has had several short-term as well as long term impacts on human health, society, economy and environment. The outbreak has also exposed weaknesses in global health systems and highlighted the need for better preparedness and coordination in responding to pandemics. The development and rollout of vaccines have provided hope for controlling the spread of the virus and mitigating its effects, but ongoing vigilance and cooperation are needed to prevent future outbreaks and ensure the health and safety of individuals and communities. Presently the impacts of COVID-19 in daily life are extensive and have far reaching consequences.

This project is aimed at analyzing and exploring the covid data with SQL using the MSSQL. This covid-19 data was sourced from Our World in Data starting from 1st January, 2020 to 10th April, 2023.
